## Rules

### Goals
The goal of this game is to get the most apples out of the two worms.

### Bolts 
When you fire your laser bolt at the opposing snake, everything from the point of contact to the end gets cut off and turned to stone.
* Notes on Bolts
    * if the bolt would have left the snake with fewer than **3** segments, the game is over.
    * if the snake is hit in the head, it's game over
