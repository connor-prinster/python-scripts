for each vertex:
    set bottleneck to 'infinity'
    set the bottleneck of vertex 's' equal to '-infinity'

build a priority queue 'Q' with bottleneck values as keys

while 'Q' is not empty:
    u = deleteMin(Q);
    for each 'v' in adj[u]
        bottleneck = max(bottleneck[u], w(u, v));
        if bottleneck < bottleneck(v):
            bottleneck[v] = bottleneck;
            pre[v] = u;
            decreaseKey(Q, v, bottleneck(v))
